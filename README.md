## FAQ

### What is alist?
alist is a modern recreation / interpretation of JesusAI.

JesusAI is a singleplayer free-to-play game about talking to a broken version of Jesus,
featuring many unlockables, extra content & 3 endings to achieve.

The game released, however, due to optimizations being found, a group of developers wanted to recreate the game entirely.

While @enfier and @atomjp are currently the only developers, more are planned to contribute to the project eventually.

### Should I play alist or JesusAI?
Both are great games; however, alist is a more modern version of JesusAI.

For the original experience, play JesusAI. For an updated versiom, play alist.

### Will the game be free to play?
Yes.

### Can I contribute?
Currently, no.

### Will there be any other releases for other OS'?
While the game is 100% intended for Windows systems, Linux support is being discussed.

### Will the game be available on itch.io when it gets finished?
Yes.

### Will it be free there, too?
Yes.
